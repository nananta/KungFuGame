# Kung Fu Panda Physics!

A fun, physics-based web game where a kung fu panda charges at and breaks stacked objects.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Use the RIGHT ARROW key to run faster
3. Use the UP ARROW key to jump
4. Crash into stacks of objects to break them
5. Score points based on the impact force of your collisions
6. Press the Restart button to play again

## Game Mechanics

- The panda character accelerates when you hold the right arrow key
- Jump to hit objects at different heights
- The more momentum you build up, the more force you'll apply to the objects
- Score is calculated based on the impact force of your collisions

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript
- Matter.js physics engine
